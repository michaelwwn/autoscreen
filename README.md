## Problem Statement

The recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs in Australia, Hong Kong, and the United States signifies a major step toward mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. This development has created a new class of affluent individuals with wealth linked to cryptocurrencies. However, private banks currently face significant challenges in adapting their KYC processes due to the inherent anonymity of blockchain transactions. This makes it difficult to verify the source of funds.

The primary challenges include identifying nested transactions within a blockchain, tracing the origin of funds, and identifying counterparties. Although existing players in the crypto KYC market utilize machine learning and blacklisting to provide on-chain solutions, these methods fall short of addressing the complex and layered nature of cryptocurrency transactions.

When onboarding clients whose wealth stems in part from cryptocurrencies, KYC officers are required to exert additional effort in anti-money laundering measures during the source of funds verification process.
